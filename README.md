# Personal dotfiles

## Repository layout

Note that [`home/`](home) contains the files to be installed into the user home
directory, which keeps those files separate from things needed to maintain and
use the repository. Thus, [`.vscode/`](.vscode) contains Visual Studio Code
configuration pertinent to maintaining this repository; it does _not_ contain
files to be installed into `~/.config/Code/User/`.
