  install:
    name: Install checks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4 # repository available as $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
      - run: shellcheck -- *.sh
      - run: shellcheck home/.bash* # these are sourced scripts too

      # These steps test that a fresh install actually works. To that end, do a
      # couple things to make the environment more like a regular Ubuntu system
      # and less like a GitHub Actions runner:
      #
      # - remove files that Ubuntu wouldn't normally ship to users (e.g. Ubuntu
      #   normally sets up users with a `~/.profile` that does things like add
      #   `~/bin` to the `PATH` and sourcing `~/.bashrc`; GitHub Actions also
      #   has a `~/.bash_profile` which would prevent `~/.profile` from running)
      # - run `test.sh` under a login `shell` so it can pickup `~/.profile` (and
      #   thus have a correct `PATH` for accessing `~/bin` scripts); without
      #   this, GitHub would run the script as `bash --noprofile --norc`, which
      #   doesn't setup the `PATH` and doesn't exercise bash-related dotfiles
      #
      # Note that having `install.sh` and `test.sh` as separate steps is helpful
      # for `~/.profile`, which doesn't actually add `~/bin` to the `PATH`
      # unless it actually exists. On the GitHub Actions runners, this path does
      # not exist, but `install.sh` will create it.
