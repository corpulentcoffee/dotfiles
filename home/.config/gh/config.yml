aliases:
    # Additional notes on how aliases work (correct as of March 2021):
    # - Aliases trying to override the built-in subcommands (like `repo`) aren't
    #   supported and are ignored.
    # - The shell completion code output by `gh completion` doesn't take aliases
    #   into account, so neither the aliases themselves nor arguments/options
    #   for the proxied commands are completed.
    #
    # Given the basic nature of alias support by `gh`, keep things here simple
    # and reserve more complex things for external `gh-xxx` scripts.
    #
    # See <https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_alias_set> or `gh help alias set`
    # for additional examples.
