# `FRX` is exported if `LESS` is not set (see `core.pager` on `man git-config`):
#
# - retain 'F' to avoid paging if there is less than one screenful of output
# - add 'I' to enable case-insensitive searches by default
# - retain 'R' allow color codes to work
# - add 'S' to scroll long lines instead of wrapping
# - drop 'X' to enable mouse and touchpad scrolling
